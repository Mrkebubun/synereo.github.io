  content: "Thank you for this excellent post.  I have spent my career at the intersection
    of technology and (to use your term) \"social value\" - high school teacher, corporate
    foundation at a major software company, technology in international development.
    I am 50 yrs old and I can remember the Internet before it had pictures - the era
    of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-net\" title=\"free-net\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">free-net</a>. Most recently, my work is focused on <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_tactics_of_collaboration\"
    title=\"The Tactics of Collaboration | SSIR\" rel=\"nofollow\"> collaboration
    with the goal of emergence</a>. I see this as the process of bringing together
    the parts of system - the nodes of a network - to that the whole that is created
    is greater than the some of its parts. All of this is to say that I am frequently
    asked about building collaborative platforms.  Setting aside the Field of Dreams
    problem of build it and they will come, my experience tells me that \"building
    a collaborative platform\" is non-trivial and no technology will <em>make</em>
    people collaborate.  However, people do collaborate and we need technology to
    asynchronously facilitate that collaboration to extend its social value.  As you
    have very compellingly described above, the social networks we have are not built
    to maximize the social value of the collaboration but to maximize the profit of
    the networks owners. I have always been skeptical of gamification and this blog
    has given me a better way to talk about it. Thank you for that. \r\n\r\nI am eager
    to work with Synereo. Specifically to facilitate asynchronous collaboration across
    social enterprises and impact investors and their broad network of stakeholders."

  content: Next time I read a blog, Hopefully it won't fail me just as much as this
    particular one. After all, I know it was my choice to read through, nonetheless
    I truly thought you'd have something interesting to say. All I hear is a bunch
    of complaining about something that you could possibly fix if you weren't too
    busy looking for attention.

Why do we need a new social network? Aren't our current networks just fine? People spend hours on Facebook! Surely they're that means they're doing something right.<br />
... right?

<h4>Before we discuss social networks, let's examine this important question as it relates to games.</h4><br />

In this lecture, Jonathan Blow argues that game designers have found a way to "engineer around boredom". This is not new - games have always acted as massive time sinks, with lifetimes dedicated to chess, gambling or even tennis. And while many of these games benefit us in all sorts of ways - humans have been <a title="Why do we play games?" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5jDspIC4hY#t=329" target="_blank">playing games throughout history</a> for their positive effects - <strong>m</strong><strong>any g</strong><strong>ames today are developed as nothing more than boredom hacks. </strong>These are no more than ways of creating positive experiences and a sense of accomplishment for otherwise meaningless actions.

Freemium games have perfected the art of wasting the user's time by making dull, repetitive tasks feel rewarding. However, unlike the anti-boredom mechanisms you may find in other games, the bells, whistles and points found in freemium games are not just there to generate a continuous stream of positive, re-affirming experiences, but to create a user journey that culminates in real-money purchases.

The animations, notifications and constantly-increasing numbers make you feel as if you've accomplished something, when in fact you've wasted your most precious assets: your time and attention. And the reason you were made to waste these is... monetization. Deepening someone else's pocket.

<h4>How do these meaningless games prevent us from getting bored and stopping, then?</h4><br />

Blow claims that boredom is a technique for something like a simulated annealing function, to make sure you don't get stuck in a local maximum. We get bored so we know when it is time to change things up and try something new, just in case there are better alternatives to our normal routines. In other words, <strong>we get bored to make sure that what we're doing is valuable.</strong> Jonathan argues that game designers have found ways to systematically fool our boredom check, causing us to invest ourselves in games with a sense of purpose when in fact nothing whatsoever is getting accomplished. Engineering around boredom has disrupted our basic methods for making sure our activity is being put to good personal or social use.

Synereo's <a href="http://digitalinterface.blogspot.co.il/2014/10/our-social-networks-are-broken-heres.html" target="_blank">Daniel Estrada has made the same argument about our social networks</a>: we expect that our social labor will contribute to the well-being of our communities, and we expect the feedback we get from our communities to reflect the social value of our work. In fact, we're spinning our wheels in the mud: our digital labor is exploited for corporate advertising revenue, and the structure of our communities reflects the value the financial economy places on our attention.

<strong>Our social behavior is being optimized for monetization by social networks that direct our attention without regards to real social benefit or to our well-being.</strong>

If our social networks are "to speak to the human condition", we need a social network that can fill us with a sense of purpose and community identity that will give us what <a href="http://hcjournal.org/ojs/index.php?journal=jhc?page=article?op=view?path%5B%5D=37?path%5B%5D=11">Mary Catherine Bateson calls a "sense of agency"</a> - "a sense that they indeed can make a difference - and a sense of how different kinds of action interact for good or for ill."

We're building Synereo so that we can reclaim our sense of agency. So we can use our time and attention to benefit ourselves and our communities.

Help us take back these social spaces. <a href="http://www.synereo.com/" target="_blank">Help us make a difference</a>.
