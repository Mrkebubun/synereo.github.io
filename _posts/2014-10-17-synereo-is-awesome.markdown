The <a title="Synereo" href="http://www.synereo.com" target="_blank">Synereo</a> project has been in the works for quite some time and we are proud to finally make our efforts public. Synereo represents a new collection of ideas and paradigms, and a very realistic set of changes that we would like to see in our world.

Synereo is the result of a single, simple thought: Human nature belongs to Human kind. The ongoing monetization of our relationships, desires, interests and ambitions enabled by the monitoring of our every step is something that we've endured for far too long.

We are willing to accept that social media was in its infancy. It needed to grow and become mainstream before the full gamut and scale of its problems could be appreciated. We believe that now is time to lead our social networks to maturity; to find solutions that work for us. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32" src="http://blog.synereo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/statistic_id278414_number-of-worldwide-social-network-users-2010-2017.png" alt="statistic_id278414_number-of-worldwide-social-network-users-2010-2017" width="1000" height="743" />

What will our networks look like five, ten, or thirty years from now? Can we really accept a world where our moods are constantly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds" target="_blank">being manipulated by clever advertising algorithms</a> for increased advertiser ROI or where our data is available to a <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/02/03/facebook-linkedin-google-microsoft-reveal-data-showing-range-accounts-requested-nsa/" target="_blank">government agency of any country s</a>imply because local legislation allows it? If we are to change our trajectory and build a future that belongs to all of humanity, then we must find a better way.

Synereo is the next and much needed logical step in the evolution of social media. It is an idea whose time has come, and we are happy to see so many talented and passionate people recognize this, providing their support for the project.
